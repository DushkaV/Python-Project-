# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python and scikit-learn for image-based machine learning through an eigenfaces exercise. The dataset consists of Spanish chamber of representativesâ€™ images and metadata (name, surname, gender, political party). The notebook walks through the process of data preparation, descriptive analysis, clustering, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and classification.

# Project Workflow

## 1. Data Modeling

- Diputado class stores information (name, surname, gender, party, image).
- Parlament class stores a collection of representatives.

## 2. Data Preparation

- Import dataset (CSV + image files).
- Stack images into arrays and create dependent variables.

## 3. Exploratory Analysis

- Gender proportions.
- Most common male/female names.
- Dataset size and party distribution.

## 4. Image Statistics

- Compute and visualize the mean representative.
- Compute and visualize the standard deviation representative.

## 5. Unsupervised Learning

- K-Means clustering (10 clusters).
- Visualize group samples.

## 6. Dimensionality Reduction

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compute eigenfaces.
- Visualize score plots colored by gender and political affiliation.
- Plot eigenvectors and explained variance.

## 7. Classification

Apply a non-linear classifier to predict gender from representative images.
